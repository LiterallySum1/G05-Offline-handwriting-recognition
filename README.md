# IOS Offline-handwriting-recognition-Application

Note: this is incomplete and does require some changes.

Generally, this was meant to be a project about IOS app that works in conjunction with a RNN OCR model. 
Sadly, I kinda ran out of time on a bunch of stuff and just decided to post what I could get working for people to see.
Im mostly missing:
- A OCR model that is either .mlmodel or .tflite,
- Application of that model into the app,
- an "import image" button.

I'm not extremely experienced in GitHub, Swift, or AI modeling and any help that I could get would be great to hopefully finish this app.
Going back to above, any input is great - even if it makes this app just slightly better!

Ill probably update this as I want this to be a mostly for fun, non-program related project.

Cutting out all of this seriousness, enjoy!
