# IOS Offline handwriting recognition application

Note: this is incomplete and does require some changes.

Generally, this was meant to be a group project about IOS app that works in conjunction with a RNN OCR model. 
Sadly, we kinda ran out of time on a bunch of stuff and just decided to post what we could get working for people to see.
It's mostly missing:
- A OCR model that is either .mlmodel or .tflite,
- Application of that model into the app,
- an "import image" function.

I'm not extremely experienced in GitHub, Swift, or AI modeling and any help that I could get would be great to hopefully finish this app.
Going back to above, any input is great - even if it makes this app just slightly better!

My group (hopefully) and I will probably update this as I want this to be a mostly for fun, non-program related project.

Cutting out all of this seriousness, enjoy!
